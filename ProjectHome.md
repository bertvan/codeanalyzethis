This Visual Studio Add-In can disable code analysis for all projects in the openened solution, and restore the original settings.

It will only restore the settings if your project is still opened.

Code analysis severely slows down builds and is just plain annoying. By using this add-on you can disable CA, and restore before checking in your code.

**Current version:**
Still pre-alpha version. It does the job but there are still a lot of practical issues. For more details, please visit the [issues](http://code.google.com/p/codeanalyzethis/issues/list) page.

**License:**
I am not familiar with administering Open Source so I just picked the GNU GPL v3 license. If anyone has any considerations towards the license, please let me know.
